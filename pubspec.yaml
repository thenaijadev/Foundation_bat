# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/lottie/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
#    - family: Inter
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Black.ttf
#          weight: 900
#
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf
#          weight: 700
#
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-ExtraBold.ttf
#          weight: 800
#
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-ExtraLight.ttf
#          weight: 200
#
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Light.ttf
#          weight: 300
#
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
#          weight: 400
#
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
#          weight: 500
#
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
#          weight: 600
#
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Thin.ttf
#          weight: 100
